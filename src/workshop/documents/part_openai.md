# OpenAI Module

## OpenAI Discussion
This module will demostrate how to use OpenAI for extracting and classifying data in ESG documents.

The Azure OpenAI service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-3, Codex and Embeddings model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.

## SynapseML Discussion
SynapseML will be used to leverage OpenAI in Databricks.

SynapseML is an ecosystem of tools aimed towards expanding the distributed computing framework Apache Spark in several new directions. SynapseML adds many deep learning and data science tools to the Spark ecosystem, including seamless integration of Spark Machine Learning pipelines with Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), LightGBM and OpenCV. These tools enable powerful and highly scalable predictive and analytical models for many types of datasources.[SynapseML Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/SynapseML/)
