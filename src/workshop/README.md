# Welcome to the **ESG-HACK-TO-LEARN** Workshop

# Introduction

This hack-to-learn workshop leverages Azure Cloud Services to deliver an end to end ESG document processing solution. The architecture presented provides a framework for adding additional enhancement **“skills”** that can derive insights about the documents and interrogate the document using the guidance of the different reporting frameworks.

This workshop attempts to inspire the art of the possible by showing how Azure Cloud , Azure Cognitive Services + OpenAI can be orchestrated into a proof of value that can quickly scale to production. Key features are :
1. Demonstrating Azure Cognitive Services that enable the building of data processing pipelines
1. Cracking & Enhancing documents with Azure Cognitive Search
1. Using Azure Cognitive Services AI to train and deploy custom models into a pipeline.
1. Incorporating various services and tools into the pipeline to extract insights
1. Using OpenAI + Structured Prompts + Rules to extract data from unstructured data and classify documents

We appreciate all feeback!
