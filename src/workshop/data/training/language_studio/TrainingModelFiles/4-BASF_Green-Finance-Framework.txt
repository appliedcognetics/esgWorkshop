1. Corporate Purpose “We create chemistry for a sustainable future”
BASF SE is the largest operating company and the ultimate parent company of the BASF Group. BASF 
Group is a transnational chemical company. The company’s portfolio is grouped into six segments: 
Chemicals, Materials, Industrial Solutions, Surface Technologies, Nutrition & Care and Agricultural 
Solutions. 
BASF has companies in more than 90 countries and operates six Verbund sites and 361 additional 
production sites worldwide. The Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, is the world’s largest chemical 
complex owned by a single company that was developed as an integrated network. The company supplies 
products and services to around 100,000 customers from various sectors in almost every country in the 
world. BASF’s customer portfolio ranges from major global customers and medium-sized businesses to 
end consumers. 
BASF wants to contribute to a world that provides a viable future with enhanced quality of life for everyone. 
By creating chemistry for customers and society and by making the best use of available resources, 
sustainability is at the core of the company’s operations. For BASF, sustainability is a driver for growth as 
well as an element of risk management.
To underline this, sustainability is firmly embedded in BASF’s corporate purpose “We create chemistry for 
a sustainable future,” and is a cornerstone of the company’s strategy. BASF supports the objective of the 
Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. Innovative climate protection 
products, such as insulation materials for buildings or battery materials for electromobility play a role here. 
BASF is continually working to reduce carbon emissions and has already almost halved carbon emissions 
since 1990 through improvements to processes and methods, while simultaneously doubling sales product 
volumes.
Corporate Commitments
BASF has defined sustainability focus areas within its corporate strategy. These formulate the commitments 
with which BASF positions itself in the market and how it aims to meet the growing challenges along the 
value chain, see Figure 1.
Figure 1 BASF Corporate Commitments
3/13
We source responsibly. As a global business, we have a responsibility to manage our supply chain 
carefully. We strive to procure responsibly and use raw materials efficiently. That is why we take an interest 
in our suppliers, their products and the entire supply chain. The BASF “Verbund” system is an important 
component of our resource efficiency concept: The by-products of one plant often serve as feedstock 
elsewhere, helping us to use raw materials more efficiently.
We produce safely for people and the environment. Our global safety and security concepts serve to protect 
our employees, contractors and neighbours as well as to prevent property and environmental damage and 
protect information and company assets. Operational excellence is key to outperforming the competition 
sustainably, long-term. We are connecting across BASF to operate in the most efficient way possible.
We drive sustainable solutions. A growing need for food, energy and clean water for a growing world 
population, limited resources and protecting the climate – innovations based on chemistry play a key role 
for these challenges, as they contribute decisively to new solutions and business models which enable 
decoupling growth from the consumption of finite resources. Effective and efficient research and 
development is a prerequisite for innovation as well as an important growth engine for BASF.
We value people and treat them with respect. Engaged and empowered employees are key to our success. 
We are connecting across our business and industry to create good relationships with our partners and 
stakeholders. With our solutions and responsible business conduct, we want to contribute to a better quality 
of life for everyone.
Sustainability Management Aligned with SDGs
As a member of the UN Global Compact, BASF actively supports the Sustainable Development Goals 
(“SDGs”). BASF helps achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) via its 
products, solutions and technologies, for example through climate protection measures. BASF also 
contributes to other goals, such as No poverty (SDG 1) and Zero hunger (SDG 2), Good health and wellbeing (SDG 3), and Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6).

2. BASF Green Finance Framework
BASF has established this Green Finance Framework under which the company intends to issue Green 
Finance Instruments, which may include bonds, loans, promissory notes (Schuldscheindarlehen) and any 
other green finance instruments, to finance and/or refinance sustainable products or projects with a clear 
benefit to environment and/or society.
The International Capital Markets Association (“ICMA”) Green Bond Principles are a set of voluntary 
guidelines that recommend transparency and disclosure and promote integrity in the development of green 
financing instruments. The BASF Green Finance Framework follows the ICMA Green Bond Principles 
(hereafter “GBP”) 2018 edition1 as well as the LMA Green Loan Principles (GLP) 2018 edition2, which 
provides guidelines in the form of four core components: 
1. Use of Proceeds
2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection
3. Management of Proceeds
4. Reporting
The Framework may be subsequently revised or updated as the green finance market continues to evolve. 
3. Use of Proceeds
The net proceeds of BASF’s Green Bond will be used to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, new 
or existing projects (“Eligible Projects”) from any of the Eligible Green Products/Project Categories as 
defined below:
• Eco-efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and 
processes
• Renewable energy

Recycling: ChemCycling products and plants
Since mechanical recycling is limited, e.g., due to high 
sorting requirements and decreasing material quality in 
each cycle, BASF is developing innovative technologies 
that promote recycling of plastics. This includes research 
and development on new materials and additives that 
facilitate recycling processes as well as several chemical 
recycling processes to create value out of waste. 
Chemical recycling allows to recycle waste for which 
there are no recycling solutions or missing capacities 
today and is therefore complementary to mechanical 
recycling.

BASF has targets in place to steer its product portfolio towards more sustainable businesses: 
• Increase sales from Accelerator products to €22 billion in 2025 (€15 billion in 2019)
• BASF intends to stop selling Challenged products within maximum of five years after 
classification. Challenged products are not eligible for green financing under this framework.
4. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection 
Products and projects financed and/or refinanced through the Green Finance Instrument proceeds are 
evaluated and selected based on compliance with the eligibility criteria by the BASF Sustainability 
Committee formed by members of Corporate Treasury, Group Reporting & Performance Management, 
Corporate Sustainability and Investor Relations.
BASF applies internationally recognized environmental requirements, “Do No Significant Harm” as well as
minimum safeguards for many of its activities, including those financed with the proceeds of the Green 
Finance instruments. In the first step, all solutions of a business unit portfolio are subject to a so-called 
“Check for Basic Sustainability Requirements” to systematically and proactively identify solutions which are 
likely to be affected by a sustainability issue, either at present or in the foreseeable future. Within this check, 
each solution in its respective application and region is evaluated based on corporate minimum and 
stakeholder specific economic, environmental and social criteria. Solutions which are identified as likely to 
be affected by a sustainability issue are subject to a separate Impact Check for analysing the significance 
of the sustainability issue in a following step. Solutions which have successfully passed the initial Check 
for Basic Sustainability Requirements are then, in a second step, subject to a Check for Sustainability Value 
Contribution which intends to evaluate the solution’s sustainability contribution compared to competitive 
solutions in the same application and region.
In order to define an Accelerator product, BASF uses a method called Sustainable Solution Steering (SSS)4
(see Figure 3 and appendix) which has been assured by an external auditor. The methodology is also 
adopted by other companies in the chemical industry and known as the Product Portfolio Steering 
Framework of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBSCD)5. The objective of SSS
is to provide a fully transparent and consistent evaluation of the sustainability performance of BASF’s 
solutions. It provides the basis for actively steering a portfolio towards a more sustainable profile.

By identifying key drivers and issues in customers’ industries, BASF is able to assess the sustainability 
contribution of each of its products in its specific application. 
With its approach BASF evaluates the entire value chain considering industry- and region-specific views 
in the markets. BASF strives to achieve a balance between the three dimensions of sustainability:
• Economy, e.g., potential cost savings for customers through the use of BASF products
• Environment, e.g., ensuring standards are met, developing environmentally sound solutions
• Society, e.g., enhancing safety in production, use or end-of-life, stakeholder perception of 
solutions
In addition to our Sustainable Solution Steering Methodology, BASF has a long-standing expertise in 
taking Life-Cycle considerations into account when assessing products or processes. BASF established 
this holistic method already in 1996 and was one of the first companies in the chemical industry to do so. 
The Eco-Efficiency Analysis was most recently validated by NSF International in 2016. The EcoEfficiency Analysis follows ISO 14040:2006 and 14044:2006 for environmental life cycle assessments. 
The assessment of life cycle costs and aggregation to an overall Eco-Efficiency is based on ISO 
14045:2012.6
BASF is evaluating the criteria for chemicals in the EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities and evaluates 
a translation matrix with its own Sustainable Solution Steering method.7

5. Management of Proceeds
BASF intends to allocate the proceeds from the Green Finance Instruments to an Eligible Green Project 
Portfolio, selected in accordance with the use of proceeds criteria and evaluation and selection process 
presented above. 
Over time, BASF will strive to achieve a level of allocation for the Eligible Green Project Portfolio which 
matches or exceeds the balance of net proceeds from its outstanding Green Financing Instruments.
Activated eligible green assets shall qualify for refinancing without a specific look-back period, provided 
that at the time of issuance they follow the relevant eligibility criteria. Eligible green capital expenditures
and operational excellence measures shall qualify for refinancing with a maximum three-year look-back 
period before the issuance year of the Green Finance Instrument.
Whilst any Green Finance Instrument net proceeds remain unallocated, BASF will hold and/or invest, at its 
own discretion, in its treasury liquidity portfolio, in cash or other short term and liquid instruments or pay 
back a portion of its outstanding indebtedness, the balance of net proceeds not yet allocated to the Eligible 
Product Portfolio.
6. Reporting 
BASF will make and keep readily available reporting, covering the allocation of net proceeds to the Eligible
Green Project Portfolio and, wherever feasible, reporting on the impact of the Eligible Green Project 
Portfolio, at least at the category level. Reporting will take place in line with BASF’s general annual reporting 
cycle until net proceeds of Green Finance Instrument have been fully allocated.
BASF intends to provide aggregated reporting for all of BASF’s Green Financing Instruments and other 
potential sustainable financings outstanding. BASF will align, on a best effort basis, the reporting with the 
portfolio approach described in “Handbook – Harmonized Framework for Impact Reporting (June 2019).”
6.1 Allocation Reporting 
The allocation report may provide:
• Allocation per Green Eligible Project Category
• Balance amount of unallocated net proceeds
