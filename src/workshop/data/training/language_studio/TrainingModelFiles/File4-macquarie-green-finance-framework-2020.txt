1. Introduction
1.1 Business overview
Headquartered in Sydney and founded in 1969, Macquarie Group (“Macquarie”) is a global financial group 
with a presence across 31 markets and assets under management of $A606.9 billion (as at 31 March 2020). 
Macquarie’s breadth of expertise covers asset management, retail and business banking, wealth 
management, leasing and asset financing, market access, commodity trading, renewables development, 
investment banking and principal investment.. These activities are divided among the following four business 
groups:
1. Macquarie Asset Management
2. Banking and Financial Services
3. Commodities and Global Markets
4. Macquarie Capital
Macquarie acts primarily as an investment intermediary for institutional, corporate, government and retail 
clients and counterparties around the world. We have established leading market positions as a global 
specialist in a wide range of sectors, including resources and commodities, renewables, conventional 
energy, financial institutions, infrastructure and real estate and have a deep knowledge of Asia-Pacific 
financial markets.
Macquarie’s renewable energy commitment
Macquarie - and its managed funds - is one of the world’s largest investors in renewable energy having 
invested or arranged $A9b in green projects in FY20.
Macquarie has a substantial and longstanding commitment to the renewable energy sector, offering a full 
range of financial services and products across the organisation that target investments in green 
infrastructure projects to support the transition to a low carbon economy. We service clients across various 
renewable energy technologies including solar, wind, waste to energy, bioenergy and energy efficiency.
Our support for the renewable energy and clean technology sectors is part of a broader commitment to 
infrastructure. Macquarie, through its Macquarie Asset Management business, manages over 150 
infrastructure and real assets used by ~100+ million people every day and co-invests alongside the world’s 
leading institutional investors including public sector pension funds.
A further example of this commitment is the 2017 acquisition by a Macquarie-led consortium of the UK Green 
Investment Bank. This acquisition created a global pioneering green investment business, acting as the Green 
Investment Group (“GIG”).

2. Framework Concept
This Macquarie Green Finance Framework (“GFF”) has been developed to demonstrate how the Group and 
its other entities intend to enter into Green Financing Transactions (“GFT”) to fund projects that will deliver 
environmental benefits to support Macquarie’s business strategy and vision.
Green Financing Transactions will include bonds, loans and other debt or financing structures which support 
Eligible Projects, as defined below. More specifically:
• Bonds issued under the GFF will be in alignment with the Green Bond Principles1 (GBP 2018) or as they 
may be subsequently amended.
• Loans issued under the GFF will be in alignment with the Green Loan Principles2 (GLP 2018) or as they 
may be subsequently amended.
• Other forms of financing may conform to other sustainable or green finance principles as may have been 
established at the time of such financing transaction being undertaken.
GFT may be raised in any currency or tenor and with other terms and conditions including covenants, to reflect 
Macquarie’s financing strategy and commercial terms agreed between the Issuer/Borrower and 
Manager/Arranger/Lender.

3. Macquarie’s Green Finance Framework
For each GFT, Macquarie asserts that it will adopt the following 4 pillars as described in GBP 2018 and GLP 
2018:
1. Use of Proceeds
2. Project Evaluation and Selection
3. Management of Proceeds, and
4. Reporting
3.1 Use of Proceeds
The proceeds of each GFT will be notionally allocated against the financing or the re-financing3 of “Eligible 
Projects” that provide clear environmental sustainability and climate change benefits.
The Eligible Projects means projects that comprise financing which fall within the categories below, which are 
or have been originated by the various business units of Macquarie.
Eligible 
Projects
Alignment with GBP 2018 
and GLP 2018 Description and Examples

from renewable sources including the below and the 
ancillary infrastructure including but not limited to 
development of land, transmission lines and sub-stations 
for each renewable energy project:
— Wind (onshore and offshore)
— Solar
— Sustainably sourced biomass
— Tidal
Energy 
Efficiency
Energy efficiency — Investment in technology, product or system(s), 
demonstrating a clear, measurable improvement in 
energy efficiency appropriate to each asset class

Exclusionary Criteria:
• Activities and lending to an industry or technology which directly involves:
— Fossil fuel
— Nuclear
— Biomass suitable for food production
—
3.2 Project Evaluation and Selection
The Green Finance Working Group (“GFWG”) will have responsibility for governing and implementing the GFF. 
The GFWG comprises representatives from Treasury, Credit Risk, Environmental and Social Risk and the GIG 
Green Investment Ratings Team.
Respective business units will identify potential Eligible Projects based on the criteria in the GFF’s Use of 
Proceeds section outlined above.
Potential Eligible Projects will be submitted to the GFWG for review and confirmation that they qualify as 
Eligible Projects based on:
• Description of the project and the engineering approach setting out the environmental benefits to be 
obtained versus alternative approaches
• Preliminary or final certificates received in respect of compliance with relevant standards
• A suitable Green Opinion4 provided by the GIG Green Investment Ratings Team whereappropriate
In addition to meeting the green loan or bond eligibility criteria, all projects are assessed under Macquarie’s 
group-wide Environmental and Social Risk (ESR) policy and ESR assessment tool during the investment 
decision process. The ESR Policy and tool provides a robust due diligence process and evaluates ESR issues 
including labour and employment practices, climate change, human rights, resource efficiency, pollution 
prevention, biodiversity and cultural heritage. The approach is based on international guidelines including the 
International Finance Corporation Performance Standards.
3.3 Management of Proceeds
The proceeds of each GFT will not be credited to a dedicated account and will be deposited in Macquarie’s 
general funding accounts. The internal governance process to allocate proceeds against Eligible Projects in 
an appropriate manner (as required in the GLP’s) is described below.
Through the GFWG, Macquarie will maintain a register of GFT and Eligible Projects and implement a 
monitoring and reporting process to ensure that:
• The total funding required5 for Eligible Projects is greater than the outstanding principal amounts due on 
GFT.
• Eligible Projects are owned within the consolidated entity which raises the GFT that is notionally allocated 
against the Eligible Projects.
• Eligible Projects do not have other financing (a) secured against them, or (b) attributable to them in respect 
of another ‘use of proceeds’ obligation.
4 Green Opinion is an opinion provided by the Green Investment Ratings Team on the prospective transaction. It includes information on the 
anticipated environmental sustainability and/or climate change mitigation benefits of the assets to be financed by the transaction and will be a 
requirement for any transaction included in the Green Loan Facility 5 This is calculated as the legal commitment Macquarie has agreed to invest in an eligible project as reflected in contractual arrangements entered 
into by Macquarie, irrespective of whether the commitment is drawn or undrawn. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the purchase price 
for an eligible project, the total committed exposure to an eligible project or an equity contribution to an eligible project.

The register will include the following information:
1. Type of GFT: Information including,
— issuer/borrower entity,
— transaction date,
— tranche information including; currency and principal amount of proceeds, repayment or amortisation 
profile, maturity date, and interest or coupon, where relevant the common identifier number (e.g. ISIN 
number).
2. Allocation of Use of Proceeds: Information including:
— Name and description of Eligible Projects including; Macquarie entity that has made the investment, 
total investment made.
— Amount of GFT proceeds which have been notionally allocated against each Eligible Project.
— The remaining balance of GFT proceeds yet to be allocated against Eligible Projects (if Eligible 
Projects ever fell below outstanding principal amount of GFT).
Any balance of issuance GFT proceeds which are not yet allocated to Eligible Projects will be held in 
accordance with Macquarie’s normal liquidity management policy.
3.4 Reporting
Macquarie will publish a Green Finance Report on an annual basis. The Green Finance Report will contain 
information on allocation and impacts:
1. Allocation Reporting
Macquarie will provide the following information for GFTs raised and outstanding during the period:
— The amount allocated to Eligible Projects in aggregate
— The remaining outstanding balance of GFT funds which have not yet been allocated
— Examples of Eligible Projects (subject to confidentiality disclosures)
2. Impact Reporting
Where possible, Macquarie will report on the anticipated environmental sustainability and/or climate 
change mitigation benefits resulting from Eligible Projects. This report will be completed by the GIG Green 
Team using their market leading methodology.
Subject to the nature of Eligible Projects and availability of information, Macquarie aims to include, but not 
limit to, the following ‘Impact Indicators’.
Eligible Project Categories Impact Indicators
Renewable Energy — Renewable energy generation (MWh)
— CO2 (or other GHG) emissions avoided / reduced (tonnes of CO2e)
— Fossil fuel consumption avoided (tonnes of oil equivalent)
