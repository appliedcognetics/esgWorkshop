GLP’s approach to sustainability
GLP is committed to a broad range of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) commitments 
that elevate our business, create value for shareholders and investors, support employees and 
customers, and show respect to the local communities in which we work in. 
We focus on improving efficiency across our businesses through the use and integration of data and 
technology, which allows us to reduce consumption, better manage assets and invest capital more 
efficiently and in turn generate better returns, reduce costs and help our global employees to be more 
productive and enhance their livelihood.
To date, GLP has 203 sustainable building certifications (such as LEED, BREEAM, BELS, CASBEE, DBJ, 
DNJB, EDGE and HQE) in our portfolio, helped corporations such as L’Oreal and Adidas reduce carbon 
emissions by 1.2M tons and possessed 1.5 million square meters of rooftop solar panels globally 
producing approximately 135,000 MWh of renewable energy.
GLP aims to invest in green and/or energy efficient buildings which contributes to the transformation 
of real estate towards a zero-carbon economy. As such, GLP aims to integrate ESG values into our 
business strategy as business builders and investors to promote good business ethics and focus on 
building a more sustainable and resilient future. 
The GLP ESG Policy Framework guides GLP in developing ESG commitments, integration into our 
overall business and investment approach, responsibility of implementation and monitoring and 
reporting framework. The GLP ESG Policy Framework is a reference and guide to internal stakeholders 
across GLP and as well as for selected external stakeholders such as existing or prospective investors 
and financiers.
GLP is committed to contributing to the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(“SDGs”):

Green Finance Framework
GLP believes that Green Finance Instruments (“GFI”) are effective tools to channel investments to 
projects that have demonstrated environmental benefits and thereby contribute to the achievement 
of the SDGs. GLP intends to align the funding strategy with our mission, sustainability strategy and 
objectives through the issuances of GFIs. 
GLP has established this Green Finance Framework under which the company intends to issue GFIs, 
which may include bonds, loans and any other green finance instruments, to finance and/or refinance 
new and/or existing green assets or projects promoting environmental progress.
The International Capital Markets Association (“ICMA”) Green Bond Principles 2018 edition1 and the 
Loan Market Association (“LMA”) Green Loan Principles 2020 edition2
,The ASEAN Capital Markets 
Forum (“ACMF”) ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2018 edition3 are a set of voluntary guidelines that 
recommend transparency and disclosure and promote integrity in the development of green financing 
instruments. The GLP Green Finance Framework follows both standards, and provides guidelines for 
the GFIs in the form of five core components: 
1. Use of Proceeds
2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection
3. Management of Proceeds
4. Reporting 
5. External Review
The Green Finance Framework may be subsequently revised or updated as the green finance market 
continues to evolve.

1. Use of Proceeds
Eligible Green Portfolio
A portfolio of eligible green assets (together forming the “Eligible Green Portfolio”) qualifies the use 
of proceeds under the categories and eligibility requirements listed in the table below. 
The eligible use of proceeds contribute to three main environmental objectives, i.e. climate change 
mitigation and promotion of green buildings. The eligible use of proceeds also contribute to the SDGs 
as listed below (this list is not exhaustive given the interconnectedness of the SDGs).

Green Eligible 
Category Description Eligible Projects Contribution to
the SDGs
Clean 
Transportation
New or existing vehicles in logistics management and 
transportation to develop green smart supply chain hubs 
such as:
• Zero tailpipe emission vehicles (e.g. hydrogen, fuel 
cell, electric)
• Hybrid vehicles that meet emission intensity 
thresholds set by market standards such as EU 
Taxonomy or Climate Bonds Initiative
• Tools and technology to optimize route management 
of field services
2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection
GLP has established the following decision-making process to determine, assess and document the 
eligibility of projects. The selection of the projects is carried out by GLP’s Global ESG Committee 
(“GEC”), composed of members of the Sustainability team, Finance, Treasury and in cooperation with 
relevant Property Management units. Eligible Green Projects selection and evaluation is based on:
• Expected eligible amounts
• Pre-defined eligibility criteria as described in this Green Finance Framework
• Evident contribution of the selected projectstoward reducing CO2 emissions or facilitating the 
reduction thereof
The GEC will also be responsible to:
• Monitor the Eligible Green Portfolio
• Exclude projects that no longer comply with the pre-defined eligibility criteria or have been 
disposed of and replace them, on a best efforts basis
• Validate annual reporting for investors
• Maintain the Green Finance Framework up to date in order to reflect any changes with regards 
to the evolution of GLP’s sustainability strategy and targets and to be in-line with market best 
practices and latest standards
GLP takes care that the Eligible Green Portfolio complies with official national and international 
environmental and social standards as well as local laws and regulations on a best efforts basis. GLP 
will apply minimum environmental and social requirements for its activities including the investment 
standards mentioned in Section 1.
3. Management of Proceeds
GLP intends to allocate the net proceeds from its GFIs to the Eligible Green Portfolio, selected in 
accordance with the pre-defined eligibility criteria and project evaluation and selection process 
presented above. This portfolio consists of new and existing assets.
Over time, GLP will strive to maintain a level of allocation for the Eligible Green Portfolio which 
matches or exceeds the balance of net proceeds from its outstanding GFIs. Additional Eligible Green 
Projects will be added to the Issuer’s eligible green asset portfolio to the extent required, in 
accordance with the pre-defined eligibility criteria.
GLP Pte Ltd – Green Finance Framework Page 9 of 11
Pending the allocation or reallocation, as the case may be, of the net proceeds to eligible green 
projects, GLP will invest the balance of the net proceeds, at its own discretion, into bank deposits, 
investment funds, money market funds or liquid marketable instruments, until the allocation to new 
eligible green projects. If for any reason, any assets were no longer eligible, GLP will use its best efforts
to substitute such asset, as soon as practical once an appropriate eligible substitution option has been 
identified.
To prevent double counting of eligible projects, GLP will ensure that the same capital investment will 
not be listed twice in the allocation of net proceeds. 
4. Reporting
GLP will report on the allocation of net proceeds and associated environmental benefits annually until 
the proceeds of each GFIs have been fully allocated, and as necessary in the event of material changes 
or in case of substitution of eligible green projects. This report will be made available on GLP’s
website4
. 
Allocation reporting
The allocation report may provide:
• Aggregated amount of allocation of the net proceeds to the Eligible Green Projects, at 
category and sub-category level, with a description or selected case studies if feasible
• Balance of any unallocated proceeds invested in bank deposits, investment funds, money 
market funds, or liquid marketable instruments
• Proportion of net proceeds used for financing versus refinancing
Impact reporting
On a best efforts basis, GLP intends to report on the environmental impacts of the Eligible Green 
Projects funded with the GFIs through a dedicated impact report5
. GLP intends to align, on a best 
efforts basis, the reporting with the portfolio approach described in “Handbook – Harmonized 
Framework for Impact Reporting (April 2020)”.6
The impact reporting will aim to provide, where feasible, metrics regarding the Eligible Green Project’s
environmental impacts, as described below:
Green Eligible Category Examples of impact reporting indicators 
Green Buildings
Level of certification by property/asset
Annual GHG emissions reduced / avoided (t C02 eq pa)
Annual energy savings (MWh pa)
Renewable Energy
Capacity and production of renewable energy generated (MW)
Estimated annual CO2 emissions avoided (in tCO2 and in TCO2eq.), 
direct and indirect impact
Clean Transportation Annual GHG emissions reduced / avoided (t C02 eq pa)

Impact Reporting may be supplemented by qualitative and/or case-study reports on outcomes and impacts of the Eligible Green Projects funded. Where 
relevant, information may be provided on data reporting and impact assessment methodologies to increase transparency.
